## About
Classic chess game for two players! Playable from the console
This is a two-player chess game written in Ruby and played in the console. Valid moves are calculated by deeply duplicating the board object. Multi-level class inheritance allows code to be lightweight, and easy to modify.

## How To Play
Download or clone the repo, then from the chess directory, run
'ruby lib/game.rb'.
If you don't see colors, run bundle install first!
